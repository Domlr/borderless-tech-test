Tech test for Borderless

I got up to having the main page complete, and having access to the user information on the particular user detail page.

I would have wanted to complete this page further, though I ran out of time.

Another thing I wanted to do, was move all the styles(inline tailwind) into scss files to tidy up the DOM a little bit.


one other thing I did, was use an image and flag generator url so randomly genereate the urls and append them to the object
